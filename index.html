                <h1>1. Take Advantage Of Existing Trends</h1> <br>
                <p>
                    TikTok's algorithm prioritizes content based on popularity and the number of views. <br>
                    <br>
                    Therefore, marketing teams should utilize trending hashtags and memes to create relevant content appealing to their target audience. <br>
                    <br>
                    Unlike advertising set up on other social media platforms, TikTok requires your team to be engaged to keep up with the latest trends. <br>
                    <br>
                    Users on this platform will seek out content under trending hashtags that can help introduce your brand to a new audience. <br>
                    <br>
                    Leveraging existing trends can expand your creativity and tap into content that you already know successfully draws in viewers. <br>
                    <br>
                    Kraft took advantage of the popular Duet challenge on TikTok and the use of the hashtag #KraftMacMeSkip to engage with their audience, attracting over 6 million views. <br>

                <h1>2. Use Hashtags</h1><br>
                <p>
                    Hashtags contribute largely to the content that lands on the TikTok for you page (FYP). Trending hashtags will also be clumped together and displayed on the discover page, so it's crucial to pay attention to these keywords when using TikTok for a marketing campaign. <br>
                    <br>
                    While many users tend to throw any trending hashtag into the caption of their TikTok video, this isn't necessarily the best tactic for gaining views or brand awareness—especially for marketing purposes. Instead, you'll want to be selective about which hashtags you choose to include. The best way to do this is by studying other videos under the same hashtag, taking note of trends, and trying to recreate them in a way that shows off your unique brand. <br>

                <h1>3. Tap Into the Power of Influencers</h1><br>

                <p>
                    TikTok is a popular app that has the power to get your brand and product in front of a lot of people. But knowing when to post on TikTok is a crucial part of being successful. Influencers follow the trends, and they're generally one step ahead, getting content involving your brand noticed by people who care about fashion, beauty products, and more. <br>
                    <br>
                    When picking out an influencer partner, make sure they target niche audiences with qualities similar to your target audience. Otherwise, you'll look spammy or generic. Younger audiences that use TikTok value authenticity. They don't want to be “sold” to. Influencers help your marketing seem genuine instead of a traditional sales advertisement. <br>

                <p>
                    Like most social networks, TikTok supports frequent user engagement. Comments are an excellent way to achieve this. Ideally, you will build up conversations with your potential customers. <br>
                    <br>
                    TikTok ranks comments by the number of likes they receive, so make sure you think through your comments, making them meaningful. Avoid making bland "nice video" type comments. <br>
                    <br>
                    Likewise, take the time to look at other people's videos and make thoughtful comments on them. <br>

                <h1>5. Use Effects</h1><br>
                <p>
                    One of the more unique aspects of TikTok is their library of different visual effects. While these may seem unrelated to marketing, they can actually be used as a powerful tool for gaining views. <br>
                    <br>
                    Here's the thing: when you see a video with an interesting effect on it, you can click on the effect. From there, you'll be taken to a new page full of other videos that have used the same effect. Many users will see interesting thumbnails and find themselves clicking on other videos in the collection, purely out of curiosity. <br>
                    <br>
                    If a brand can get their video on one of these discover pages, they can increase their views through this method alone. Not to mention, some of these visual effects can be pretty eye-catching—so it never hurts to try them out! <br>

                <h1>6. Tell a Story</h1><br>
                <p>
                    While consumers are eager to buy a product they love or believe in, personalizing the narrative behind your brand is what truly secures an audience and customer. Creating a story behind your product allows you, as the business owner, to relate to your audience. Attaching a “story” to your brand identity can help you to tie specific narratives and themes to your brand that drive sales. <br>
                    <br>
                    A key component to consider is that the best TikTok ads do not feel like someone is selling you a product. Humanize your brand and create a relatable and intriguing narrative to succeed on TikTok. <br>

                <p>
                    So now that you know some of the best ways to elevate your TikTok campaigns, you should be ready to start posting. However, if you're still unsure of the best content for your brand, the only way you are going to learn what works is by diving in head first and doing your research. <br>
                    <br>
                    Start by getting familiar with the app, use the search features and find other brands and people who are creating similar content like yours. Save trending songs and sounds for later, to help create fun and relevant content, or test out the video editing tool to add engaging captions and pop-ups for informational videos. As well, use the duetting feature to react/speak to people who may be having a problem that you have the solution for. Finally, answering comments in video format is an amazing way to create lots of content once you've gained a small following. <br>    
                    <br>
                    At the end of the day, look at what works and doesn't work, apply it to what you think is achievable with your brand, and enjoy the process. Yes, TikTok is a video platform first and foremost, but it's also an explosively popular social media app. It stands to reason that if you plan on running a successful social media campaign for your business — TikTok should be part of your strategy. <br>

                <h1>9. Master TikTok SEO</h1><br>
                <p>
                    TikTok has over 1 billion users posting and sharing content. If you want your videos to get attention, you'll need to master TikTok search engine optimization (SEO): <br>
                    <br>
                    TikTok Hashtags:Use relevant trending hashtags with your post to expose it to a larger audience. Do your research to find long-form hashtags with low competition where your content can actually rank at the top rather than getting buried under thousands of other videos. <br>
                    <br>
                    Naming Conventions:Use a profile name that's easy for users to search for and find. If you post freelance writing tips, include “freelance” and “writing” in your name and about section to increase your discoverability. <br>
                    <br>
                    Engagement:SEO begins with creating content that users love. Your goal should be to get new users to watch your content (from beginning to end) and watch more of your videos. If you can achieve that, then the TikTok algorithm will start spinning in your favor and help your content take off. <br>
